Cron is a daemon that executes commands at specified intervals. These commands are called "cron jobs." Cron is available on Unix, Linux and Mac servers. This can be used for:
A. Updating nvim.
B. Updating plugins in nvim.
C. The script we have to show battery icon when we connect our laptop to power source or remove it. We can make it run every 15 seconds or so using chron instead of making the script sleep for 15 seconds.
